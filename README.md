## About Parkinson Disease →

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty
with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin
gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have
difficulty walking and talking. Parkinson's disease dementia becomes common in
the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and anxiety are also common,
occurring in more than a third of people with PD. Other symptoms include
sensory, sleep, and emotional problems. The main motor symptoms are
collectively called "parkinsonism", or a "parkinsonian syndrome". 


## About Parkinson Disease Dataset →

In this study, we aim to analyze and diagnose patients with Parkinson Disease (PD)
on speech datasets. The data used in this study were gathered from 188 patients
with PD (107 men and 81 women) with ages ranging from 33 to 87 (65.1Â±10.9)
at the Department of Neurology Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The
control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages
varying between 41 and 82 (61.1Â±8.9). During the data collection process, the
microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the examination, the sustained
phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions.
